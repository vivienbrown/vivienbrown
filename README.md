- ⚡ Fun fact: ... Did you know that turtles can 'breathe' through their bums? It's called 'Cloacal Respiration' and they use it to survive underwater for months in case they can't reach the surface! They also use it to control their buoyancy like a submarine ... I had a boyfriend once who was like a turtle;always under the weather! I'm more like a songbird...
