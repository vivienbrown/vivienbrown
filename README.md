- 👋 Hi, I’m @vivienbrown
- 👀 I’m interested in ... tending an impossible food forest jungle in my suburban apartment, baking my own sourdough and cooking from scratch ... meditative breathing, telepathic communication with animals, astronomy, macrame and finger-knitting, drawing and creative writing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... hydroponics 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Not sure yet
- 📫 How to reach me ... send me a message
- 😄 Pronouns: ... she/her/they/one
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... Did you know that turtles can 'breathe' through their bums? It's called 'Cloacal Respiration' and they use it to survive underwater for months in case they can't reach the surface! They also use it to control their buoyancy like a submarine ... I had a boyfriend once who was like a turtle;always under the weather! I'm more like a songbird...
