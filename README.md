- 👋 Hi, I’m @vivienbrown
- 👀 I’m interested in ... tending an impossible food forest jungle in my suburban apartment, writing my own original songs and playing them on piano, while parenting. I like to macrame, write, cook things from scratch, and play Fallout, Skyrim and Hogwarts legacy. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... hydroponics, agile systems, interior decorating and how to make cheese.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Not sure yet
- 📫 How to reach me ... send me a message
- 😄 Pronouns: ... she/her/they/one
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... Tree rings not only show their age, they show what the tree survived. A particularly harsh winter will show as a thicker ring; our history is written in nature before it ever makes it to a book.
